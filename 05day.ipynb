      ", there was a little girl who lived in a small village. She had a very happy life, and she loved to play with her friends. One day, she was playing in the forest when she came across a magical creature. The creature was a beautiful unicorn, and it told the girl that it could grant her one wish. The girl was so excited, and she immediately wished for a new doll. The unicorn granted her wish, and the girl was so happy. She ran home to tell her parents all about it, and they were just as happy as she was. From then on, the girl always played with her new doll, and she always cherished the memory of meeting the magical unicorn.\n"
